-led_control_ws : workspace of the block that controls leds 

-demosaicing_ws : workspace of the block that does the demosaicing (contains other functions (white balance/ homegenise light) that needs to be made in an independant WS)

-camera_control_ws : main code that does the whole pipeline (started as cam control only, hence the name) 



-BMP_BS : library (+ documentation) that allows opening & editing bmp images in Cpp
-dcraw : tool that converts RAW images to ppm (and then bmp)
-main-ws : where i put the executables of the different blocks

#### White balancing algorithmic ####
#####################################
white balancing:
	- open object image & white ref image
	- for each pixel of white ref image, calculate the coeffs of rgb : 
		1- check 'max' val btwn r,g,b 	
		2- coeff_R = max / white_R
		   coeff_G = max / white_G
		   coeff_B = max / white_B
	- for each pixel of object image, multiply the r,g,b values with the equivalent coeffs calculated in step 2
	-save image
